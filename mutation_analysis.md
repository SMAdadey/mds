Mutation Analysis
---
What to look out for
- Residue conservation of wild-type and mutant (and surrounding residues) in related organisms
- Size of wild-type and mutant residues
- Location (domain, motifs, etc)
- Contacts made (among/within domain)
- Potential function of domain or motif
- Structural change?
